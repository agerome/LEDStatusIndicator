There was no way of changing color besides manually using a jump cable to power them.\r\n![first prototype](pictures/prototype1.jpg)\r\n\r\nSecond Protype\r\n--------------\r\nThe second prototype did not use a breadboard, instead I soldered the cables to the resistors to the LEDs. The anodes are all soldered together and the cathod so the LEDs are toggled by manually providing power to the desired LED.\r\n![second prototype](pictures/prototype2.jpg)\r\n\r\nThird Prototype\r\n---------------\r\nThe third prototype was housed in a cardboard box, the cables to power the LEDs would go over and around the door to the inside of the room where I could control which lights turn on.\r\n![third prototype](pictures/prototype3.jpg)\r\n\r\nFourth Prototype\r\n----------------\r\nThe fourth prototype uses an ATMega168, a push button, and an RGB LED. The button iterates through the various preset colors on the LED.\r\n![fourth prototype](pictures/prototype4.jpg)\r\n\r\nFifth Prototype\r\n---------------\r\nThe goal of the fifth protype was to reduce parts, size, and costs, as well as make it battery powered. We used an ATTiny45, a capacitor, four resistors, a push button, jumper cables, and RGB LED.\r\n![fifth prototype](pictures/prototype5.jpg)\r\nIn order to make it battery powered, we drastically reduced the frequence of the internal oscillator as well as made the LED pulse at interval instead of constnatly on.\r\n\r\nFirst Beta\r\n----------\r\nThe PCB boards from our friends at Oshpark! (PS: They're awesome!)\r\n![first beta](pictures/beta1.jpg)\r\n\r\nFrom the backside\r\n![first beta](pictures/beta2.jpg)\r\n\r\nFrom the front side\r\n![first beta](pictures/beta3.jpg)\r\n\r\nHere's how it looks mounted on the door!\r\n![first beta](pictures/beta4.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks on the other side of the door.\r\n![fourth prototype](pictures/prototype4b.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
